        The image above is of a <i>‘skeleton watch’</i>. The spinning mechanism in such ‘naked’ watches partly reveals how a watch operates. At the core of traditional watches lies a spring that is wound in a circle. When the spring releases tension, it sets the watch in motion.

    <p>
        &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
        Traditionally, watches required a high level of craftsmanship and time to be made. It made portable timepieces <i>scarce and expensive</i>. With their history of high demand, many watches are decorated with expensive gemstones and precious metals. 
        
        <br><br>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;A beautiful example is this 18k white gold watch. The cover is made of sapphire crystal, has been inlaid with a multitude of diamonds and has been finished with an alligator-skin wristband.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;On the flipside of expensive, decorative, labour-intensive and one-of-a-kind watches is the world of mass-produced watches. During the Japanese Miracle (1980s), brands such as Casio and Seiko sold watches all across the world. 
<br><br>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Timepieces such as the one we see above, simultaneously mark a strong development in watch-making: the advent of completely <i>digital watches</i>. This development still carries on as smartwatches continue to be improved; some even function as fully-fledged GPS-devices.

    <p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Certain watches combine the old watchmaking world with the new: these are called ana-digi (analogous & digital).</p>

    <p> 
        &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In resemblance with skeleton timepieces, watches with an ‘open heart’ expose part of their internal mechanics. You could view this as a traditional way for the watchmaker to proudly reveal the work. Despite modern developments and the rise of mass-produced pieces, you could (optimistically) argue that suchlike passion has remained the <i>beating heart</i> of the watchmaking industry. 
        
        <br><br>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Every company manifests its take on design, art, quality and technique in its own way. On the customer’s part: some continue to wear their favourite timepiece daily and thereby make it a persistent asset in the way they present themselves.
